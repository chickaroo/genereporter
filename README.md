## Elevator pitch

<!-- start elevator-pitch -->

- **Automatic Gene Report** --- genereporter automatic generates an analysis and visualization of the gene of interest. Across three different areas--cell type specific, gene set enrichment analysis, and sample (patient) specific--genereporter can help researchers quickly access and understand the scRNA-seq data and information easily, which usually is a heavily computational task. However, genereporter is built to be customizable and adaptable to users that wish to dive into the code.
