- **Automatic Report** --- Automatic generation of the gene of interest analysis. 
- **Varied Analysis Approaches** --- from classic UMAPs to gene regulatory networks, percent detection rates and more. 
- **Tailored to VEO-IBD Multiomics Data** --- developed only with this dataset in mind. 
- **Customizable** --- with just a little Python knowledge, the plots are yours to customize. 
- **Sami Worked Very Hard On This!**
