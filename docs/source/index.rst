Welcome to :purple:`genereporter's` documentation!
========================================

:purple-bold:`genereporter` is a Python library Sami developed as part of her Bachelor's thesis. 

:purple:`genereporter` can help researchers of any background quickly visualize and understand a gene of interest's expression levels in their specific dataset.

Using scRNA-sequencing data (for now), :purple:`genereporter` generates automatic analysis reports and visualizations, granting wet-lab
researchers access to output usually generated by computational researchers. 

:purple:`genereporter` has three different modes of analysis: 

* Cell type specific
* Gene regulatory network (GRN) specific
* Sample (patient) specific

:purple:`genereporter` is available to implement as a no-code front-end interface for wet-lab researchers, or as a python library for bioinformaticians to integrate into their pipelines.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information.
